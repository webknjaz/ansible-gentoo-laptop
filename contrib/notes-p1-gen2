 * 
 * When switching from PulseAudio, you may need to disable PulseAudio:
 * 
 *   systemctl --user disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
 * 
 * To use PipeWire, the user units must be manually enabled
 * by running this command as each user you use for desktop activities:
 * 
 *   systemctl --user enable pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket
 * 
 * A reboot is recommended to avoid interferences from still running
 * PulseAudio daemon.
 * 
 * Both new users and those upgrading need to enable WirePlumber
 * for relevant users:
 * 
 *   systemctl --user disable pipewire-media-session.service
 *   systemctl --user --force enable wireplumber.service
