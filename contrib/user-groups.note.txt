Working as root on a Unix/Linux system is dangerous and should be avoided as much as possible. Therefore it is strongly recommended to add a user for day-to-day use.

The groups the user is member of define what activities the user can perform. The following table lists a number of important groups:

Group	Description
audio	Be able to access the audio devices.
cdrom	Be able to directly access optical devices.
floppy	Be able to directly access floppy devices.
games	Be able to play games.
portage	Be able to access portage restricted resources.
usb	Be able to access USB devices.
video	Be able to access video capturing hardware and doing hardware acceleration.
wheel	Be able to use su.
